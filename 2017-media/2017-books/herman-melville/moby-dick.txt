This All-American maritime epic encapsulates the human condition into the turbulent life on a whaling vessel. Whether you're a traveler wanting to see the world, whether you're just trying to make a living as a whaleman, or whether you're seeking influence and power over your fellow man, you're always at the mercy of your superior's ends--no matter how morally questionable they are--, and you're always at the cruel, impartial, and heedless mercy of nature. No matter what path you choose, no matter what you choose to believe, and no matter how lofty your goals, the ocean will continue to ebb and flow after it swallows you whole.
