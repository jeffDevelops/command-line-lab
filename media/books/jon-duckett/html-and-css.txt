A really visually-appealing encyclopedia of HTML tags and attributes, and CSS properties, that explains how HTML and CSS work in a coherent way. Duckett breaks down syntax down to every last symbol. It's a great tool to initially learn the basics, but it's also great to have around for when you're like: "what was that one clearfix trick?", or "how does the multiple backgrounds syntax work?"
